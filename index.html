<h1>History of Bikes </h1>
<p>The concept of the bicycle dates back to the early 19th century when the German inventor Karl Drais developed the "running machine" or "Draisine" in 1817. <br>It was a wooden vehicle propelled by the rider's feet pushing against the ground. <br>This invention laid the foundation for the modern bicycle. <br>Over the years, various iterations and improvements were made, including the addition of pedals, chain drives, pneumatic tires, and gearing systems. <br>The safety bicycle, with two equally sized wheels and a chain drive, became popular in the late 19th century, setting the stage for the bicycles we know today.</p>
